# Part 1: Local Backend with Flask and PostgreSQL

This repository contains the source code for my medium tutorial that you can found on <a href=''>Part 1: Local Backend with Flask and PostgreSQL</a>

In this tutorial, we spin up a local backend including a Flask app and a PostgreSQL database and let the two interact with each other. Some example routes are added as a way to demonstrate a basic API implementation.

This tutorial is part of a series of tutorials, next tutorial: <a href=''>Part 2: Backend Deployment Pipeline to AWS Elastic Beanstalk &Â RDS</a> (<a href=''>GitHub Repository</a>).
